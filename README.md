A Python script to send bulk WhatsApp messages using OCR to avoid resending. It automates browser interactions via PyAutoGUI, reads screenshots with Tesseract OCR,
and detects if a message has already been sent to a contact based on keywords. Useful for small businesses or campaigns needing message deduplication.
